## Introduction


Medical technology as a term refers to a variety of devices that help health practitioners to improve the quality of life for patients and society by conducting an early diagnosis, decreasing complications, optimizing therapy and/or giving less intrusive choices, and shortening hospital stays. While medical technologies were mostly known as classic medical devices (e.g., prosthetics, stents, implants) before the mobile era, the emergence of smartphones, wearables, detectors, and communication systems have revolutionized medicine by allowing artificial intelligence (AI) powered tools (such as applications) to be contained in very small sizes.

The general public has embraced intelligent medical technologies (i.e., AI-powered) partly because they enable a 4P model of medicine (Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Participatory) and thus patient autonomy in ways that were previously impossible; smartphones are, for example, becoming the go-to item for filling out and distributing an electronic personal health record, measuring vital functions with biosensors, and supporting in the attainment of optimal health.

Several AI-based algorithms have been registered by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the previous decade and might therefore be used. Surgical navigation systems for computer-assisted surgery, virtuality-reality continuum tools for surgery, pain control, and mental disorders are only a few examples of digital tools that enable augmented healthcare.

Hence, Due to a shortage of digital medicine education, numerous private medical schools are teaching their future medical leaders to face the challenge of augmented medicine by combining the medical and engineering curricula or including digital health literacy and usage into an enhanced curriculum.

### **Early Detection:**
AI is already being used to diagnose illnesses more precisely and in their beginning phases, such as cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, a large percentage of mammograms provide misleading findings, resulting in one out of every two healthy women being diagnosed with cancer. AI is effectively allowing mammograms to be reviewed and translated 30 times quicker and with 99% accuracy, minimizing the need for unneeded biopsies.


### **AI excels at well-defined tasks:**
Tasks, where AI can successfully show its performance in comparison to a human doctor, have been the subject of research. These operations often have well-defined inputs and a binary output that can be easily verified. A digital image is used to assess suspected skin lesions, and the outcome is a simple binary classification: benign or malignant. Under these circumstances, researchers just needed to show that AI outperformed dermatologists in terms of sensitivity and specificity when categorizing previously viewed photos of biopsy-validated lesions

Summarized in the pie chart are the broad applications of AI in medicine :

### **Doctors are being supported by Artificial Intelligence**, but not replaced by it: 
Patients must believe that consultations are being guided by human doctors since machines lack human traits such as empathy and sympathy. Moreover, patients cannot be expected to trust AI right away, as it is a technology steeped in suspicion.   Furthermore, AI is frequently used to undertake activities that are necessary but restricted in scope, leaving the primary duty for patient treatment to a human doctor

### **Treatment:**
AI can help clinicians take a more comprehensive approach to disease management, better coordinate care plans, and help patients better manage and comply with their long-term treatment programs, in addition to scanning health records to help providers identify chronically ill individuals who may be at risk of an adverse episode.
For more than 30 years, robots have been employed in medicine. They range in complexity from small laboratory robots to very complicated surgical robots that may assist a human surgeon or do surgeries.

Of course, there are pros of Artificial Intelligence in Medicine but also it has some disadvantages too. Here are some of them presented in the figure below

### **Training:**
In a manner that basic computer-driven algorithms cannot, AI allows individuals in training to go through naturalistic simulations. Because of the emergence of natural speech and the capacity of an AI machine to rapidly draw from a massive library of scenarios, a trainee's answer to questions, decisions, or recommendations can challenge in ways that a person cannot. Furthermore, the training program may learn from the trainee's prior replies, allowing the challenges to be regularly changed to fit their learning needs. And training may be done anywhere; with AI incorporated in a smartphone, fast catch-up sessions will be available after a difficult case in a clinic or while traveling


### **Challenges of Al in Medicine:**
There are three central challenges that have plagued past efforts to use artificial intelligence in medicine: the label problem, the deployment problem, and fear around regulation.

#### 1.	Healthcare as a Label Desert and One-Shot Learning
Artificial intelligence in the modern day is obsessed with data. Google uses a deep neural network to train on around 10,000 hours of annotated speech to make speech recognition on your Android phone accurate. ImageNet has 1,034,908 hand-annotated photos in computer vision. Labels are required for deep learning algorithms to operate. Each label in medicine denotes a human life on the verge of being lost. The most extreme setting is one-shot learning, where the algorithm learns to recognize a new pattern after being given only one label

#### 2. Deployment and the Outside-In Principle
Unfortunately, hospitals prioritize what they can bill for, which leads us to our fee-for-service payment system, which is ossified and dirigiste. The hospital fees for each action under fee-for-service; for example, if a patient is misdiagnosed, the hospital may perform and bill for further testing. Surprisingly, a superior algorithm may decrease the income of the hospitals that are expected to implement it. Fortunately, there is a change we can believe in. First, we don’t “ship” software anymore, we deploy it instantly. Second, the Affordable Care Act creates the ability for startups to own risk end-to-end

#### 3.Fear
The perception is that many regulatory regimes are just an expensive way to say “no” to new ideas. And that perception is sometimes true: Certificates of Need, risk-based capital requirements, over-burdensome reporting, fee-for-service: these things sometimes create major barriers to new entrants and innovations, largely to our collective detriment.



### **Conclusion**
Artificial intelligence's application in clinical practice is a promising area of research that is rapidly evolving alongside other modern fields such as precision medicine, genomics, and teleconsultation. While scientific progress in developing new solutions to improve modern healthcare should remain rigorous and transparent, health policies should now focus on addressing the ethical and financial issues associated with this cornerstone of medicine's evolution.
